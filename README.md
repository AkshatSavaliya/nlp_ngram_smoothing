# nlp_ngram_smoothing

Includes python scripts for one letter bigram model, and three word n-gram models. The word n-gram models use Laplace Smoothing, Good-Turing Smoothing, and Kneser-Ney Interpolation. All models are applied to the training data to create a model to use in solving the language identification model with regard to the test data.
